# Introduction to Algo Trading using Python

---

Here is a gentle introduction to Algo Trading using Python by implementing a very simple trading strategy using Bollinger Band and RSI

## Your task !

Once the trading strategy has been taught, you need to improve this project by implementing 3 new features : 

    1 - Create a plot of closing price by day with the bollinger bands,
    2 - Create a plot of RSI by day with lower bound and upper bound, 
    3 - Add a stop-loss condition of 90% of the closing price,
    4 - Automate the main.py in order to apply to strategy to a list of tickers,
